    Privacy Policy

    Last Updated: August 22, 2023

    Introduction:
    Welcome to "SMS to Email," developed by Khalid Alamoudi ("the Developer"). This privacy policy outlines how the app "SMS to Email" ("the App") collects, uses, and safeguards user data. By using the App, you consent to the practices described below.

    Data Collected:
    The App collects the following types of information:

    1. SMS Messages: The App reads incoming SMS messages for the purpose of providing the functionality to send them via email. The App does not access or read any other data beyond SMS messages.

    2. Phone Number (Contacts Permission): The App requests access to your device's contacts to display the phone numbers of potential email recipients more conveniently.

    3. Gmail API: The App integrates with Google's Gmail API to enable sending emails through Gmail accounts. This requires granting the App permission to access your Gmail account for sending purposes.

    4. AdMob Ads: The App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect certain non-personal information for ad targeting and reporting purposes. Please refer to Google's privacy policy for more details.

    Use of Data:
    The collected data is used solely for the following purposes:

    1. Sending SMS Messages via Email: The App processes and sends received SMS messages to the email address provided by the user. The email content is stored temporarily in local cached storage for the user to view but is not retained by the Developer.

    2. Personalization: If contacts permission is granted, the App uses your device's contacts to display phone numbers in the recipient selection interface.

    3. Gmail API: The App uses the Gmail API to send emails through Gmail accounts. The App does not store Gmail login credentials, and the data is sent directly to Google's servers.

    4. AdMob Ads: AdMob displays advertisements to users. Please note that ad data collection is managed by Google and not the Developer. Refer to Google's privacy policy for more information.

    5. Room Database Storage: The App may store SMS message data in a local database managed by the Room Persistence Library. The data is structured and stored on the user's device and is not accessible by the Developer beyond the immediate processing and sending of SMS messages. The Developer further enhances the security of this data by implementing encryption measures.

    User Consent:
    By using the App, you grant permission for the App to access SMS messages, phone numbers (if contacts permission is granted), and use the data solely for the purposes outlined in this privacy policy.

    Access Permissions:
    The App requires the following permissions:

    - Phone: Necessary to access SMS messages.
    - SMS: Required to read incoming SMS messages.
    - Contacts: Allows for more convenient display of phone numbers in the recipient selection interface.
    - Gmail Account Access: Required to access your Gmail account for sending emails via the Gmail API. This includes the permission to manage drafts and send emails.

    Data Retention:
    The App temporarily stores SMS message data in local cached storage for user viewing purposes. The data is not retained by the Developer and is deleted after use. The Developer does not have access to or retain the data once the email is sent.

    Security Measures:
    The Developer implements robust security measures to protect user data. The App uses encryption to safeguard the data processed and stored within the local database.

    User Rights:
    You have the right to:
    - Revoke permissions: You can modify app permissions through your device settings.
    - Access and delete locally cached data: The App stores SMS message data temporarily for user viewing but does not retain the data beyond immediate use.

    Changes to the Privacy Policy:
    The Developer reserves the right to update this privacy policy as needed. Users will be notified of any changes within the App.

    Contact Information:
    For questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy or the App's data practices, you can contact the Developer at smstoemail.smssender@gmail.com.

    This privacy policy is effective as of August 22, 2023.
